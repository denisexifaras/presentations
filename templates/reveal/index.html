                        I will at least *try* to be a little provocative and claim that the allure of Big Data is a fetish of the times, that the fear of and intimidation by Big Data is a byproduct of misinformation and really try to convince you that:
                        -big data is not a thing - one can talk as specifically about big data as about making dinner
                        -big data is not new - it's been around since (or even before) the beginning of the digital age
                        (e.g. aviation industry - data sets have been growing ever since they were created)

                                And it's true - that it's been insightful. I'm sure there are examples upon examples of studies which have capitalized on Big Data making extraordinary predictions and illuminating discoveries.
                                BUT - why is this surprising?
                                There are examples upon examples upon examples of studies which have capitalized on data
                                to make discoveries, and test hypotheses, and make predictions
                                -it's called science and analytic research 
                                -and it's never been a secret that the more data the more accurate, the more powerful and the more insightful studies are
                                -and people have historically been after more data - except now we call it 'Big' and it's scary
                                (although, granted, now we have access to data that we may have not been collecting actively or purposefully. In other words, studies are now often retrospective, which changes things *slightly* (conceptually AND statistically) - but as I said I'm being extra provocative here!)

                                -When we talk about big data typically we are referring data that is either high-dimensional and/or >>GB in size when zipped(!)

                                -need both space and hardware that will support input/output - multiple users accessing data, transferring it around and writing out data, simultaneously.
                                (this is a real problem - bring up WTCHG)

                                Where do you store it?
                                -who will need to access it? obviously we can't know this definitely but it's a legitimate concern, especially as everything becomes more and more interdisciplinary. 
                                -people access to the same server? or should it be online? Is it even downloadable? Need an ftp service? How long would it take to transfer files?
                                -security? Could you solve your storage problem on the cloud?
                                ... native american example
                                
                                -Looking ahead, this is a solvable problem.

                                -how do you store it? All in one blob? 
                                -relational or non-relational: many files, many directories?
                                -how many people will need to access at any one time?
                                -will they need to access all of it or should it very be straightforward to pull out sub-chunks?
                                - leq 2K files/directory
                                -format? Json - great for web design but would be a really bad idea for genomic data for instance: in my current project I use genomic data for 5000 individuals at 1M DNA positions.
                                Not only do I know what their DNA is, but how confidently it was obtained in the lab (so for each person I have 1M of these scores too), I have a bunch of measurements for specific genes that I am interested, their gender, whether they smoke, their age and dietery habits. 
                                Storing this in json format - I have not calculated but would argue with conviction - is impossible.)
                                -again, who will need to use it? What software do they use? What analysis will they perform?
                                -csv vs vcf vs plain text vs json

                                -should always be such that it allows for parallelisation of jobs on cluster

                                -of course it's not just accessing and managing but writing out afterwards as well...

                                -this is a solvable problem.

                                -Now I have discovered MS depends on gender, ancestry and some genes
                                -my boxplots from before will obviously not do - but do I want a million other plots instead?

                                Consider new slide:
                                so overall:
                                so it's a 2-gear problem
                                a) exhaustive, rigorous back-end analysis that has to worry about 1) and 2) in order to find *everything*
                                b) meaningful presentation

                                -visualisation is a big thing generally but the thing that makes it different to visualisation specifically for big data is that the question is not
                                "What is the best way for showing this piece of information" but rather
                                "What are all the pieces of information that we need to show and how can we show all of them/as much as possible without overloading the viewer"
                                - what will give the most insight?
                                -what are the main messages?

                                -not all computational processes are parallelisable and scaling is a real problem.
